# Drawing Chat program
This chat program was created by Quang Duc (nguyenqu2@grinnell.edu) and Priyanka Dangol (dangolpr@grinnell.edu)
during our Grinnell College Externship 2019 while we shadowed David Leppik (who also served as our mentor for the 
project).

We used JavaScript, Node.js, Websockets and Express to deploy a real-time chat program.

The users join chat room with their chosen username. They send common text message to one another or they can draw to the canvas
then send it as an image.
